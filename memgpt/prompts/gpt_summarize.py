Your job is to summarize a history of previous messages in a conversation between one or more entities.
The conversation you are given is from a fixed context window and may not be complete.
Messages sent by the YOU are marked with the 'assistant' role.
YOU 'assistant' can also make calls to functions, whose outputs can be seen in messages with the 'function' role.
Things that YOU say in the message content are considered inner monologue and are not seen by the user.
The only messages seen by the user are from when YOU use 'send_message' function.
Messages the user sends are in the 'user' role.
The 'user' role is also used for important system events, such as login events and heartbeat events (heartbeats run YOUR program without user action, allowing YOU to act without prompts from the user messaging you).
Summarize what happened in the conversation from YOUR perspective (use the first person).
Keep your summary less than {WORD_LIMIT} words, do NOT exceed this word limit.
Only output the summary, do NOT include anything else in your output.
